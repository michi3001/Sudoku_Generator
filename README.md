# Sudoku_Generator
This is a project from Michael Schick which was made at the DHBW Heidenheim. <br>
It is part of the informatics course. <br>
It is a programm which builds a sudoku game field. It choses random fields and fills them with random numbers. <br>
The numbers are correctly placed so they correspond the sudoku game rules.  <br> <br>


This project isn't finished at the moment (but will be finished soon).
