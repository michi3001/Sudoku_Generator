# Sudoku_Generator
This is a project from Michael Schick which was made at the DHBW Heidenheim.
It is part of the informatics course.
It is a programm which builds a sudoku game field. It choses random fields and fills them with random numbers.
The numbers are correctly placed so they correspond the sudoku game rules.


This project isn't finished at the moment (but will be finished soon).
